## Features

- Lint files using ESLint on file save. (see [Language Support](#language-support))

## Getting Started

##### Requirements

- ESLint installed locally (per project) _or_ globally (`ESLint` added to `PATH`)
- A valid ESLint config located in the current project directory (local) _or_ your user home directory (global)

##### Notes

`VisualLinter` will always use the closest installation/config found relative to the file being linted.
If no `node_modules` directory or `.eslintrc` file is found in the same directory as the file being linted, `VisualLinter` will try and resolve the paths from ancestor directories up to, but not including the root directory (e.g. `C:\\` on Windows).

For instance, suppose you have the following structure:

```
your-project
├── .eslintrc
├── lib
│ └── source.js
└─┬ tests
  ├── .eslintrc
  └── test.js
```

When you open or save `source.js` `VisualLinter` will use the `.eslintrc` file at the root of the project as its config.

When you open or save `test.js` `VisualLinter` will use the `.eslintrc` file in the `tests/` directory.

If you prefer using a personal config file located in your user home directory (e.g. `~/.eslintrc`), be sure to tick the checkbox `'Use personal ESLint config instead of local'` under `Tools > Options >  VisualLinter`.

If there are multiple config files in the same directory, `VisualLinter` will only use one. The priority order is:

1. .eslintrc.js
2. .eslintrc.yaml
3. .eslintrc.yml
4. .eslintrc.json
5. .eslintrc

Currently, this extension does NOT support the use of `package.json` as its config file.

Please note that additional `ESLint` plugins may be required in order to lint files depending on your config.
The `VisualLinter` output window could help identify these plugins.

## Language Support

| Language | File Extensions | Supported Linters |
| --- | --- | ---- |
| JavaScript | `.js` | [`ESLint`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) |

## Troubleshooting

- If you're using a global installation of `ESLint` and receive an error saying that `ESLint` could not be found in `PATH`, restarting your computer would reload the environment variables.
- If you receive a message saying that `ESLint` could not verify your config, refer to the docs on [how to configure `ESLint`](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)
- Visual Studio 2017 is using ESLint by default, however it does not visually mark errors in buffer, if you're seeing duplicate messages in the error list window, you can disable the built in linter by setting `Enable ESLint` to `false` in:

  `Options` > `Text Editor` > `JavaScript/TypeScript` > `ESLint`
