  <!-- This is the file that defines the actual layout and type of the commands.
       It is divided in different sections (e.g. command definition, command
       placement, ...), with each defining a specific set of properties.
       See the comment before each section for more details about how to
       use it. -->

  <!-- The VSCT compiler (the tool that translates this file into the binary
       format that VisualStudio will consume) has the ability to run a preprocessor
       on the vsct file; this preprocessor is (usually) the C++ preprocessor, so
       it is possible to define includes and macros with the same syntax used
       in C++ files. Using this ability of the compiler here, we include some files
       defining some of the constants that we will use inside the file. -->
